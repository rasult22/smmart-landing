          Today books written by AI will not surprise anyone anymore 😯
        </p>
        <p>
          We have collected a list of several interesting, in our opinion, works created by neural networks:
        </p>
        <p>
          🦋 “Aum Golly: Poems of Artificial Intelligence about Humanity” is a collection of poems written in just 24 hours by the efforts of GPT — 3 at the request of Finnish writer Jukka Aalho. The titles, themes, and texts of the poems were generated by the AI itself.  
        </p>
        <p>
          🦋 “The World of Sybil: AI is rethinking itself and its world with the help of GPT-3” — the result of a collaboration of the author (Mark Strassman), editor (Fred Zimmerman) and neural network (GPT-3). Mark and Fred “asked” the chatbot Sybil to write a book about themselves and it turned out very interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          🦋 “Trying to Wake Up” is a collection of short stories created by the ruGPT — 3 neural network in collaboration with writer and artist Pavel Pepperstein: 50% of the texts are written by Pavel himself, and 50% are the merit of AI trained on his stories. So there was an interesting symbiosis of the author and his neurodeveloper,
        </p>
        <p>
          🦋 “Moon Wars” is a LitRPG written by AI and edited by Paul Bellow, a writer and AI developer. According to the plot of the neural network and Gender, the reader on behalf of an ordinary young gamer Alex will have to save the Universe.  
        </p>
        <p>
          🦋 “Autonomous Haiku Machine” is a collection of poems written by GPT-3 in the haiku genre (a traditional Japanese form of poetry). The poems are generated entirely by a neural network, without human intervention. The texts turned out to be as simple as possible in structure, but at the same time filled with deep meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you have noticed, neural networks can create in different styles and produce works in any form.
