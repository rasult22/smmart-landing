      <h1 class="mt-2 mb-12 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold md:text-center">ChatGPT writes a competent marketing article in just half a minute</h1>
      <article class="markdown gh-content space-y-4 pb-8">
        <p>
          Have you already heard the news that ChatGPT wrote quite a competent marketing article in just half a minute, for which, if the chatbot were a journalist, he would have received $615? 😯
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only noted that the neural network lacked the “author’s view”, but the logic of the narrative and the style are impressive. In addition, there were no grammatical and syntactic errors in the article, so the text did not require significant edits 👌
        </p>
        <p>
          Freelance writer Henry Williams, who started this experiment, writes for The Guardian himself. And after the revision of the result received from ChatGPT, he stated that he would take 500 pounds (615 US dollars) for such an article. Although it would have taken Williams much more than 30 seconds to do it, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, in the end, he added a statement that has become quite popular in recent months: “I’m almost sure that artificial intelligence will deprive me of my job” 👨💻
        </p>
        <p>
          Although personally, the team and I believe that it is still not worth panicking ahead of time. In addition, the advertising market, like the rest of the world, will surely adapt to the rapidly changing neurorealality.
        </p>
        <p>
          And people will simply have more tools to generate high-quality content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, we are optimists😁
